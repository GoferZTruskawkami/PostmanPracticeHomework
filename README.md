# My Postman practice homework
Based on https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

## Instruction how to run this test
1. Download the Postman app from https://www.postman.com/downloads/
2. Create an account (because it is free and it will make the whole process easier)
3. Import into Postman two files downloaded from this repository (the ones named collection and environment.json)
4. Add environment to the collection (tab in the upper right corner)
5. And run tests ;)

The last test will always come back as FAILED because this page doesn't save previous requests.
